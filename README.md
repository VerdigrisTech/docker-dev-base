Base image for setting up VS Code development environments.

![shell](./docs/shell.png)

## Overview

This image is based on [bitnami/minideb][minideb] image with [Zsh][zsh] as the
default shell. It also includes [Oh My Zsh][oh-my-zsh] framework with some
plugins pre-installed.

### Pre-installed userland tools

- `bat` (enhanced `cat`)
- `curl`
- `git`
- `glow`
- `gpg`
- `less`
- `lsd` (enhanced `ls`)
- `ssh` (client toolchain only)
- `sudo`

### Pre-installed Zsh plugins

- [F-Sy-H][f-sy-h] (syntax highlighting)
- [git][git] (git branch annotations)
- [zsh-autocomplete][zsh-autocomplete] (auto completion)
- [zsh-autosuggestions][zsh-autosuggestions] (auto suggestions)

Can overwrite these using `ZSH_PLUGINS` environment variable with a comma delimited list.

### Zsh Customization

You can provide a path to your own zshrc file using `ZSHRC_OVERWRITE`. Example to add an untracked `local` folder with a zshrc and mount the folder. Then provide this env variable to overwrite.

To just extend functionality you can use `ZSHRC_EXTRA` which will source extra zshrc startup content including PATH overwrites if desired.
